# SDK quickstart

You integrate Signaling to add low-latency, high-concurrency signaling, and synchronization capabilities for real-time systems into your game. You also use Signaling to enhance the user experience for Video Calling, Voice Calling, Interactive Live Streaming, and Broadcast Streaming.

This page shows you how to integrate Signaling into your game using Signaling SDK easily.

## Understand the code

You find the business logic for this quickstart sample in the [`SignalingManager`](../signaling-manager/SignalingManager.cs) class. This class encapsulates the code to set up an instance of `RtmClient`. All examples in this repository extend the `SignalingManager` class to add functionality specific to that application.

For context on this implementation and a full explanation of the essential code snippets used in this example, read the [SDK quickstart](https://docs-beta.agora.io/en/signaling/get-started/get-started-sdk?platform=unity) document.

For the UI implementation of this example, refer to [`Signaling.cs`](../sdk_quickstart/Signaling.cs).
