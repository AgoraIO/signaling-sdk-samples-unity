# Secure authentication with tokens

Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access a system. Agora uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they access Signaling. Each token is valid for a limited period and works only for a specific user ID. 

This example shows you how to retrieve a token from an authentication server and use it to connect securely to Signaling. 

## Understand the code

For context on this implementation and a full explanation of the essential code snippets used in this example, read the [Secure authentication with tokens](https://docs-staging-git-milestone-22-signalling-211-agora-gdxe.vercel.app/en/signaling/get-started/authentication-workflow?platform=unity) document. 
To quickly deploy a token server, see [Create and run a token server](https://docs-staging-git-milestone-22-signalling-211-agora-gdxe.vercel.app/en/signaling/get-started/authentication-workflow?platform=web#create-and-run-a-token-server). You use your token server URL for user authentication in this example.

For the UI implementation of this example, refer to [`AuthenticationWorkflow`](/Assets/authentication-workflow/AuthenticationWorkflow.cs).
